# Qrious Front End Development Test

**The task.**

Create something that resembles the “family-tree.png” design (with or without the joining lines and icons) using create-react-app, typescript and the data provided.

The requirements are as follows:

- People with a gender of "female" should have background-color lightpink
- People with gender of "male" should have background-color lightblue.
- Each box should contain the persons name
- The Tree should be able to consume any Tree, not just the one provided.

Bonus points for recursion, type-safety, tsconfig strict mode and 100% immutability.

Assumptions you can make:

- All people have TWO and ONLY TWO parents.
- Parents are defined as two people who have the same children not necessarily in the same order.
- Top level parents will be parents who BOTH don't have parents.

As a guide, it should take from 30min - 2 hrs to complete.
On completion, please return the zipped package
